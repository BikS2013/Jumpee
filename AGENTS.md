## Structure & Conventions — Documentation Map

### Where the documentation lives

- `docs/plans/` — every plan, one file per plan, named `plan-NNN-<indicative-description>.md`.
- `docs/design/` — all other planning and design documents:
  - `project-design.md` — the complete, always-current project design; update it with every new design or design change.
  - `project-functions.md` — the registry of all functional requirements and feature descriptions.
  - `configuration-guide.md` — the project's configuration guide, when one exists (structure below).
- `docs/reference/` — all reference material collected for the project.
- `docs/refined_requests/` — every refined request specification (create the folder if missing), one file per request named `refined-request-NNN-<slug>.md`. `NNN` is a zero-padded three-digit sequential number: the next number is the highest `NNN` already present in the folder plus one, starting at `001` — and when the folder has archived documents on the `docs-history` branch, the archive's numbering counts too (see "Archiving historical documents" below). `<slug>` is the request slug reused by all downstream artifacts of the same request.
- `docs/prompts/` — every prompt created while working on the project (create the folder if missing), one file per prompt named `NNN-<indicative-description>.md`. `NNN` is a zero-padded three-digit sequential number: the next number is the highest `NNN` already present in the folder plus one, starting at `001` — and when the folder has archived documents on the `docs-history` branch, the archive's numbering counts too (see "Archiving historical documents" below). The description states the prompt's use and purpose.
- `docs/tools/<tool-name>.md` — one dedicated documentation file per project tool.
- `test_scripts/` — every test script goes here; create the folder if it doesn't exist.
- `Issues - Pending Items.md` (project root) — the register of every issue, pending item, inconsistency, or discrepancy detected while working on the project. Pending items come first (most critical and important on top), completed items after. Whenever a defect or issue is fixed, check this file for an item to remove.

### How to use the documentation

- Every time an issue is solved, it must be resolved AND both the issue and the solution must be thoroughly documented.
- This file's "Tools" section (when present) lists each project tool with a one-or-two-sentence description of what it is capable of and the relative path to its dedicated documentation file under `docs/tools/` — retrieve the full documentation from there whenever it is needed. Full tool documentation must never be inlined into this file.
- Before writing any code script, consult the "Tools" section and the documentation under `docs/tools/` to check whether the planned code fits the scope of an existing tool. If so, implement it as an extension of that tool; otherwise build a generic, abstract version of the code as a new tool in the project's toolset, document it under `docs/tools/`, and reference it in the "Tools" section. The goal is to progressively grow the tools needed to test, evaluate, generate data, collect information, etc., and reuse them consistently.

### Archiving historical documents (the `docs-history` branch)

- A project MAY move accumulated historical, write-once process artifacts — deployment reports, codebase scans, refined requests, plans, session handoffs, and similar — off the default branch to keep its documentation lean. Living, authoritative documents (`project-design.md`, `project-functions.md`, the guides, tool docs, the issue register) are never archived.
- All archived documents go to a single dedicated **orphan, docs-only branch** named `docs-history`, whose tree contains ONLY archived documents at their original repository paths — so retrieval paths never change: `git show docs-history:<original-path>`, no branch switching required. A pointer note/README stays in each archived folder on the default branch stating the branch name, the retrieval command, and (for numbered folders) the next number. The archive branch is append-only: never rebase, rewrite, delete, or merge it.
- **Numbering across the archive**: for every `NNN`-numbered folder, the next number is `max(highest NNN in the folder, highest NNN under the same path on `docs-history`) + 1`. Before creating the FIRST document of a numbered category, check whether the archive branch exists (the folder's README/pointer note, or `git branch --list --all 'docs-history'`) and continue from the archive's highest number for that path — never restart at `001`, never reuse an archived number. The archive branch is authoritative over the pointer note's recorded "next number" if they disagree.
- **Migration** runs in a temporary linked worktree so the main checkout — and any uncommitted changes in it — is never disturbed: `git worktree add <tmp> docs-history` (first-time archiving: `git worktree add --detach <tmp> <default-branch>`, then inside it `git switch --orphan docs-history` and `git checkout <default-branch> -- <paths-to-archive>`); bring the new artifacts over at their original paths and commit ONLY the documents being archived; then on the default branch `git rm` the migrated files, update the pointer note, and commit referencing the archive commit. Verify with `git ls-tree -r docs-history --name-only` and a `git show` spot-check.
- Which document categories a project archives (and when) is project-specific and lives OUTSIDE this synced block — typically a "Document Archiving Strategy" section in the project's CLAUDE.md. The branch name is always `docs-history`, shared by all archived categories.

<configuration-guide>
- A configuration guide, when requested, is created at `docs/design/configuration-guide.md` and explains:
  - When multiple configuration options exist (config file, env variables, CLI params, etc.), what the options are and the priority of each one.
  - The purpose and use of each configuration variable.
  - How the user can obtain such a configuration variable.
  - The recommended approach for storing or managing the variable.
  - Which options exist for the variable and what each option means for the project.
  - Any default value the parameter has.
  - For configuration parameters that expire (e.g., PAT keys, tokens), propose adding a parameter that captures the expiration date, so the app or service can proactively warn users to renew.
